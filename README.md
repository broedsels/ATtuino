# ATtuino
The smaller Arduino project board

Based around an ATtiny and a tiny programmer.

V2.0 beta
Changed all components to SMD components. 
Used the standard 6-pin ISP connector.

The programmer part is based upon the V-usb firmware and Design found here: https://tequals0.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/attiny45-based-usbtinyisp-programmer/
